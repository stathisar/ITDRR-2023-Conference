Currently there are only 3 scripts. 2 in R and 1 in python. The R scripts are related to 1. lda models and 2. to weighting the n-grams. The python script is a demo script: LER is applied and then stored in a csv.
Please note that there is a know how on how the transformer could be fine-tuned. In case you are interested in that please contact me.
